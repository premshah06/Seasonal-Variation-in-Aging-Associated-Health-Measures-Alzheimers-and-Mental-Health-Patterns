## Project Overview
This project analyzes year-over-year trends in Alzheimer's disease prevalence and mental health metrics (e.g., frequent mental distress) among aging populations. By examining demographic and geographic data, it aims to provide actionable insights for public health strategies.

## Objective
- Analyze multi-year data on Alzheimer's and mental health trends.
- Investigate disparities based on demographics (age, gender, race) and geography.
- Correlate health trends with external factors like healthcare policies.

---

## Methodology
1. **Data Aggregation**: Organize data by year, metrics, and demographic variables.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Evaluate year-over-year changes with statistical techniques and visualizations.
3. **Geospatial Analysis**: Use heat maps to highlight regional disparities.
4. **Demographic Analysis**: Identify significant differences across demographic groups.
5. **External Correlation**: Link trends with potential external factors (e.g., interventions).

---

## Scope
- Focus on Alzheimer's and mental health metrics over multiple years.
- Analyze demographic variables (age, race/ethnicity, gender) and geographic distribution.
- Generate visualizations for trends and disparities (line graphs, heat maps).

---

## Innovation
- Integrates demographic and geospatial insights for holistic trend analysis.
- Employs advanced visualization tools for accessible, data-driven decision-making.

---

## Expected Outcomes
- Year-over-year analysis of health trends.
- Identification of key disparities in demographics or regions.
- Clear, actionable visualizations for stakeholders.
